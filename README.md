# CoCoTeX Kernel #

This repository contains the source files (including code
documentation) and the user manual for the CoCoTeX framework.

## What is CoCoTeX? ##

CoCoTeX is a programming framework for (Lua)LaTeX While it is intended
to be used with and has been developed parallel to le-tex's
[xerif](https://github.com/transpect/xerif), it can be used
stand-alone as a LaTeX package.

CoCoTeX is developed to "simplify" common requirements by various
publishers like complex headings, floats with more than one caption,
foreign language support, titlepages, etc. It adpots some principles
from object-oriented programming like inheritance, mixins, and
overloading of functionalities.

## Installation ##

## Installation of Release Versions ##

Simply copy the `cocotex.dtx` and `cocotex.ins` from the
`releases/current` folder to your local project directory and run

```
latex cocotex.ins
```
this will unpack the necessary files.

### Co-Dependencies ###

You need the following **additional** items to run certain CoCoTeX modules:
* `coco-scripts.sty` requires
  [xerif-fonts](https://subversion.le-tex.de/common/xerif-fonts/). Copy
  or sym-link the whole folder as `fonts` inside your project
  directory
* `coco-accessibility.sty` requires `ltpdfa` (pre-alpha version inside
  the `externals/ltpdfa/` folder). Copy or sym-link the whole folder
  as `ltpdfa` inside your project directory, and source the `env.sh`
  to tell LuaLaTeX where the .lua files are located.

If you use all externals, your project directory should look something
like this:

```
<your_project_dir>
  <your_main>.tex
  cocotex.cls
  coco-common.sty
  (further coco-modules)
  env.sh
  fonts
    Noto
	Junicode
  ltpdfa
    ltpdfa.sty
	ltpdfa.lua
	...
```

### Additional Recommendations ###

* `htmltabs.sty` (working pre-alpha version inside the
  `externals/htmltabs` folder) if you want to use tables with a
  html-like syntax.

## Installation from sources ##

If you want to use the included `build.sh` bash script (recommended),
you need Ruby, at least version 3.1!

Clone the git Repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/transpect/CoCoTeX.git
```

copy the `source.sh`.example as `source.sh` and adjust the environment
variables to your liking. Then, run

```
./build.sh
```

This script creates a temporary folder `temp`, merges the `.dtx` files
in the `src` directory into a single `temp/cocotex.dtx`, and runs the
installation script. The resulting .sty, .cls, and lua files are
stores inside the `build` folder.

Run
```
./build.sh doc
```
to create the User Manual and the source code documentation, or
```
./build.sh doc man
./build.sh doc source
```
to create either separately.


## Usage ##

Once the cls, sty and lua files have been unpacked and stored in a
location usable by LaTeX, the framework's modules can be used with
```
\usepackage{coco-<module>}
```
If you want to utilize all (non-experimental) modules, you can use the included document class:
```
\documentclass[pubtype=<publication_type>]{cocotex}
```
to set the underlying document class. Valid values `<publication_type>` for are:
* `article` for single articles (this uses LaTeX's standard `article` class).
* `mono` for books where all parts are written by the same author(s),
* `collection`, for books where parts are written by different authors, or
* `journal`, for a collection of articles.

The latter three types use LaTeX's standard `book` document class.

For further options, see read the End-User manual.
