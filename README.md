# CoCoTeX Kernel #

This repository contains the source files (including code
documentation) and the user manual for the CoCoTeX framework.

## What is CoCoTeX? ##

CoCoTeX is a programming framework for (Lua)LaTeX While it is intended
to be used with and has been developed parallel to le-tex's
[xerif](https://github.com/transpect/xerif), it can be used
stand-alone as a LaTeX package.

CoCoTeX is developed to "simplify" common requirements by various
publishers like complex headings, floats with more than one caption,
foreign language support, titlepages, etc. It adpots some principles
from object-oriented programming like inheritance, mixins, and
overloading of functionalities.

## Installation ##

### Dependencies ###

You need the following additional items to run CoCoTeX:
* [xerif-fonts](https://subversion.le-tex.de/common/xerif-fonts/) if you want to use `coco-scripts.sty`
* `htmltabs.sty` (working pre-alpha version inside the `externals/htmltabs` folder) if you want to use tables with a html-like syntax
* `ltpdfa` (pre-alpha version inside the `externals/ltpdfa` folder) if you want to use `coco-accessibility.sty`

TBD

## Usage ##

Once the cls, sty and lua files have been unpacked and stored in a
location usable by LaTeX, the framework's modules can be used with
```
\usepackage{coco-<module>}
```
If you want to utilize all (non-experimental) modules, you can use the included document class:
```
\documentclass[pubtype=<publication_type>]{cocotex}
```
to set the underlying document class. Valid values `<publication_type>` for are:
* `article` for single articles (this uses LaTeX's standard `article` class).
* `mono` for books where all parts are written by the same author(s),
* `collection`, for books where parts are written by different authors, or
* `journal`, for a collection of articles.

The latter three types use LaTeX's standard `book` document class.

For further options, see read the End-User manual.
