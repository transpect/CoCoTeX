# 1.0.0

## general
- NEW: Added hard requirement for LaTeX kernel version, must now be at
       least 2023/11/01 (i.e. texlive 2024 or newer).
- NEW: replaced old xkeyval class and package options with Expl3
       markup
- NEW: Framework versioning, file dates and required minimal TeX
       versions are now solely controlled via the VERSION file in the
       source code's base folder.
- FIX: improved whitespace handling in Container environments
- FIX: update `htmltabs.sty` external to account for tagging of empty
	   cells

## cocotex.dtx
- NEW: added options for PDF version and PDF standard; usage of one of
       the PDF/X standards cause disabling of hyperref.

## coco-kernel.dtx
- NEW: Added some `\ignorespaces` at the end of Component macros
- NEW: Added default value for ccPrefix (=empty)
- NEW: Attributes of Component Groups now also use Attribute
       Handlers
- NEW: Added method to check global Components against a given value
- NEW: Added a way to define Macros from Counted Components without
       full expansion
- NEW: Replaced old custom hook mechanism with LaTeX kernel hooks
- NEW: Default PDF version is determined by the selected PDF standard.
- NEW: Fixed an issue where additions to a parent Container's Types
       were not passed down to its decendents if those were declared
       earlier
- NEW: Warning when a value is attempted to be assigned to a
       Component that is undefined
- NEW: Added general error facility for patch commands
- NEW: Added function to locally disable CountedConditionals in case
       a Container instance occurs inside a Counted Component.
- FIX: made group components long
- FIX: LaTeX error when `\cc@iterate@res` is undefined

## coco-common.dtx
- NEW: added option to suppress inclusion of color profile
- NEW: added gray as one default colour profile

## coco-meta.dtx
- NEW: remove transitive role-mapping
- NEW: added MetaDatumBlock tag for complex meta data values that
	   may contain multiple paragraphs
- FIX: Error when defined simple Components

## coco-floats.dtx
- NEW: Changed how heights and widths of subfloats are calculated:
       - sameheight mechanism is now only applied if none of the
         sub-figures has a fix width or height set.
       - added Attribute to locally de-activate sameheight mechanism
       - added Property `fix-dimen` which if not true prevents image
         files from being scaled to `\hsize`.
- NEW: Changed tagging of float environments to account for
       subfloats
- FIX: Typo in generation of Listof entry
- FIX: value of class Attribute was expanded too late
- FIX: orientation Attribute was not evaluated correctly
- FIX: Hooks in list-of were still cocotex's own
- FIX: wrong expansion of \ccContentsline in Listof
- FIX: disabled tagging while measuring sub-floats

## coco-title.dtx
- NEW: added DocTitle Component and doc-book-title Properties to
	   locally override the PDF-title meta datum
- NEW: XMP meta data are parsed and written into the Document Info
       Dictionary when ltpdfa is used.
- NEW: Write document language with disabled a11y features
- FIX: XMP meta data now take preference over Meta container
       Components if the XMP does exist.
- FIX: pdfcreator and pdfproducer metadata were used the wrong way.
- FIX: Query for Cover when pubtype=journal

## coco-headings.dtx
- NEW: added hook for capturing running titles
- NEW: Tagging of headings now (mostly) independent from LaTeX's own
       sectioning hierarchies. This allows "jumps" between (TeX)
       sectioning levels while keeping the Tagging hierarchy intact.
- NEW: heading Components other than Title are now all tagged inside a
       SectMeta container, mapped to Div.
- NEW: headings, their Components, and the sect tags that they open
       can now be excluded from being tagged with the notag
       Attribute. Headings with this Attribute are tagged as
       Artifacts.
- NEW: Added tagging in default Properties

## coco-accessibility.dtx
- NEW: Keywords and Authors are now written as separated list items
       into the generated XMP files, instead of one single string.
- NEW: Added minimal math tagging
- NEW: made auto tagging of align-like environments sensitive to the
       amsmath packages loaded
- CHANGE: \ccaProtect now saves cca macros when used in \write
- CHANGE: Tag figures at \Gin@setfile instead of \Ginclude@graphics,
       since the former is patchable and we don't need to tag the
       mechanism that determins the image's file extension
- FIX: prevented hyperref from writing redundant and empty
       DocumentInfo fields
- FIX: Links now have /Contents attribute to make VeraPDF's PDF/UA1
       check happy
- FIX: Error when Links occur in \ccaDisable context

## coco-lists.dtx
- FIX: typo in doc string
- FIX: counting error
- FIX: toggles Uncounted conditionals in case of lists in Counted
       Components (like a Float)

## coco-script.dtx
- FIX: Avoid `babel-lua` errors when `bidi` is not needed
- FIX: Removed old fallback for Armenian and replaced by usescript
       system

## coco-notes.dtx
- NEW: Added automatic tagging of endnotes
- CHANGE: footnotes and endnotes are no longer reset at the beginning
       of a new chapter unless the resetnotesperchapter package option
       is set.
- CHANGE: \printnotes no longer resets the endnote counter.
