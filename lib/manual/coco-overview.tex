\begin{heading}{subsection}
  \tpTitle{Installation}
\end{heading}

The current build of the package can be obtained from GitHub:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=tex,language=bash]
git clone https://github.com/transpect/CoCoTeX.git
\end{lstlisting}
The actual source files can be found in the \lstinline{src} sub-folder.

The most recent stable version can be found in the
\lstinline{releases} folder. It contains the \lstinline{cocotex.dtx}
file, its corresponding \lstinline{cocotex.ins} file, and this
Manual as a pre-rendered PDF.

The package is installed via
\begin{lstlisting}[style=tex,language=bash]
latex cocotex.ins
\end{lstlisting}
This will create the \lstinline{cocotex.cls} file, as well as the core
modules that follow the naming convention
\lstinline{coco-<module>.sty}. These modules will be explained in
greater detail below in \fullref{sec:modules}.

The documentation of the framework's source code can be created via
\begin{lstlisting}[style=tex,language=bash]
pdflatex cocotex.dtx
\end{lstlisting}
\textbf{Note~1:} You \textit{must} use \lstinline{pdflatex} in order
to create the source code documentation! Hard dependencies for the
source code documentation are the
\lstinline{hyperref}\footnote{see~\url{https://ctan.org/pkg/hyperref}}
and
\lstinline{listings}\footnote{see~\url{https://ctan.org/pkg/listings}}
packages.

\textbf{Note~2:} The source code documentation is a technical breakdown
of the framework's source code; it is not the same document as the
more end-user oriented Manual you are currently reading.

\begin{heading}{subsection}
  \tpTitle{Usage}
\end{heading}

{\CoCoTeX} follows a \textit{modular} design. It comes with several
\lstinline{.sty} files that can be used independently from
another. However, there is also a {\LaTeX} document class file
\lstinline{cocotex.cls}, which can be used to load the whole framework
at once (sans the experimental modules,
see~\fullref{sec:intro:experimental}).

\begin{heading}{subsubsection}
  \tpTitle{Using cocotex.cls}
\end{heading}

The \lstinline{cocotex.cls} serves as stand-in for the {\LaTeX}
default document classes \lstinline{article} and \lstinline{book}. It
is called with the usual {\LaTeX} commmand:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=tex]
\documentclass[<options>]{cocotex}
\end{lstlisting}

The actual document type can be set with the \lstinline{pubtype} option:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=tex]
\documentclass[pubtype=<mono|article|collection|journal>]{cocotex}
\end{lstlisting}
The allowed values are:
\begin{description}
\item[\ttfamily mono] for monographs, i.e., books that are written by one or
  multiple authors as a whole,
\item[\ttfamily article] for single journal articles,
\item[\ttfamily collection] for books that are collections of contributions of
  multiple authors, and
\item[\ttfamily journal] for journals, i.e., collections of multiple journal
  articles.
\end{description}

\begin{heading}{subsubsection}
  \tpTitle{Using Single Modules}
\end{heading}

{\CoCoTeX} is modular. That means you can use selected modules as
packages together with \LaTeX's default or other third-party document
classes. Modules are included like any other package, e.g.,
\begin{lstlisting}[style=tex]
\RequirePackage[<options>]{coco-floats}
\RequirePackage[<options>]{coco-headings}
\RequirePackage[<options>]{coco-title}
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{heading}{section}
  \tpTitle{Design Goals and Purpose}
\end{heading}

{\CoCoTeX} is first and foremost a programming framework
designed for {\LaTeX} developers, who need to build and
maintain a number of (not too) different publisher-specific style
sheets and partly or fully automatted typesetting
processes. {\CoCoTeX} has been developed to serve as a the
rendering backend for the typesetting tool
\textit{xerif}\footnote{see
  \url{https://www.le-tex.de/en/xerif.html}}, but it is also usable as
a standalone extension to plain {\LaTeXe} projects.

The following features were the initial main design goals of the
{\CoCoTeX} framework:
\begin{itemize}
\item Handling of different document types in the same
  stylesheet:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item journal articles
  \item whole journals
  \item chapters by different authors in proceedings and collections,
  \item text collections and proceedings, and
  \item monographs by a few or single authors.
  \end{itemize}
\item Handling of recurring complex typographic elements that
  are difficult to set-up using standard-\LaTeX, e.\,g.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item headings of all levels with authors,
    subtitles, quotes, etc.;
  \item a four-way distinction of material in a heading's
    title, its pendant in headers and
    footers, and their entry in the table(s) of
      contents, and in the PDF bookmarks;
  \item the possibility to provide classes of text components
    like headings and floats, similar to classes in
    HTML/CSS; and
  \item the structured handling of meta-data, especially for
    titlepages.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The framework introduces some new concepts into {\LaTeX} programming
that are extensivley influenced by \textit{object-oriented design
  principles}.  The name {\CoCoTeX} is derived from two of those
concepts, namely \textbf{Co}ntainers and \textbf{Co}mponents. In the
next section, these concepts are exlained in more detail.

\begin{heading}[label=sec:concepts]{subsection}
  \tpTitle{Basic Concepts}
\end{heading}

One design goal of the {\CoCoTeX} Framework is to provide an easy and
unified way to configure the typesetting of blocks of inter-connected
data.

Take \textit{headings}, for instance: They always consist of
a~\textit{Title}, but also may have some sort of \textit{Numbering},
some headings have a~\textit{Subtitle}, some might have a~dedicated
\textit{Author}, some are followed by a~\textit{Quote} or
a~\textit{Motto}, and those in turn have \textit{Sources}. Headings
may re-appear (partly) in the \textit{header} or \textit{footer} of
a~page, as well as in the \textit{table of contents}, in some cases
with slightly altered contents\footnote{One use-case might be {\LaTeX}
  markup, which may occur in the title (think mathematical symbols)
  and the table of contents, but are forbidden in the PDF
  bookmarks. Another example are over-long headings that need to be
  shortened for the page header but should be printed in the table of
  contents unaltered.}.

\begin{heading}[label=sec:overview.containers]{subsubsection}
  \tpTitle{Containers}\index{Container|textbf}
\end{heading}

Such a~bundle of structured information is in the {\CoCoTeX} framework
referred to as a~\textbf{Container}. In the aforementioned
\textit{heading} example, the information pieces “Title”, “Subtitle”,
“Author”, etc., together form a closed unit “heading”.

Containers can be derived from one another. For instance, the abstract
concept “heading” might be extended to various levels, like “section”,
“chapter”, “paragraph”, or “part”. Some of the abstract constituents,
like \textit{title} or \textit{number}, are shared among all those
derivations of the concept “heading”, while others might
not. E.g. “Author” is usualy used on “chapters”, but rarely on
“sections” or “paragraphs”. The mechanism to pass certain properties
or constituents from one Container to another is called
\textbf{Inheritance}\index{Inheritance|textbf}.

\begin{heading}[label=sec:overview.components]{subsubsection}
  \tpTitle{Components}\index{Component|textbf}
\end{heading}

The inter-connected pieces of information that constitute a Container
are called \textbf{Components} in the {\CoCoTeX} framework. Most basic
components are simple {\LaTeX} macros that take one argument for the
content that is to be stored inside that Component for the respective
Container.

Some Components can be collections of other Components. An “Author”
Component of a “heading” Container, for example, can contain a~first,
a~middle and a~last name, an~academic title, an~affiliation, or
an~email address, among other things. Those complex Components are
called \textbf{Component Groups}\index{Group Container|textbf}.

Some Components may occur multiple times in the same Container. A~good
example are multiple “authors” that contibuted to the same “chapter”
in a “collection”. Those possibly recurring Components are called
\textbf{Counted Components}\index{Counted Component|textbf}. Note that
despite the name, it is not necessarily the case that those Counted
Components are numbered or even ordered in any way. Rather,
``Counted'' refers to the way they are processed internally. Due to
the way both concepts are implemented in {\CoCoTeX}, Group Containers
are always also Counted Containers and vice-versa, so both terms might
be used interchangeably.

\begin{heading}[label=sec:overview.properties]{subsubsection}
  \tpTitle{Properties}\index{Properties|textbf}
\end{heading}

While headings of the same level are usually rendered the same way for
a given publisher style, the actual typeface of a particular heading
may vary, depending on the Components that are actually filled with
content: A~numbered heading might look slightly different than one
without a~number; a~heading with a~subtitle might have different
spacing than one without a~subtitle, and so on. How Components are
processed and ultimatly rendered is controlled by so-called
\textbf{Properties}.

Properties are mostly short pieces of {\LaTeX} code that are usually
set by the style-sheet developer according to a publisher's guidelines
and requirements. One of the design goals of {\CoCoTeX} is to keep the
code behind those Properties as comprehensible and pointed as
possible.

\begin{heading}[label=sec:overview.types]{subsubsection}
  \tpTitle{Types, Scope and Modular Inheritance}\index{Type|textbf}
\end{heading}

Properties and Components can be seen as Container‐specific Data
\textbf{Type}s. They are only defined within the scope of their parent
Container and are usually not accessible from the outside, unless they
are marked as \textit{global}. When a new Container is declared, it
can inherit the Data Types from one or multiple other containers.

\begin{heading}[label=sec:oop]{subsection}
  \tpTitle{Concepts from Object-Oriented Programming}
\end{heading}


In principle, \textbf{Containers} are comparable to the concept of
\textit{classes} in object-oriented programming. A concrete “heading”
in a document is an \textit{instance} of that class or
Container. \textbf{Components} serve as \textit{class variables},
while \textbf{Properties} can be seen as \textit{instance
  methods}. \textbf{Types} can include macros and control sequences
that are somewhat comparable to \textit{class methods}. The
\textbf{Inheritance} and \textbf{Type} mechanisms are comparable to
\textit{Mixins} in some object-oriented programming languages like
Ruby.

\begin{heading}{subsection}
  \tpBMTitle{Implementation of {\CoCoTeX} Concepts in LaTeX Documents}
  \tpTitle{Implementation of {\CoCoTeX} Concepts in LaTeX Documents}
\end{heading}

In a document's \lstinline{.tex} source code, \textit{Containers} are
realised as {\LaTeX} environments. \textit{Simple Components} are
{\LaTeX} commands that take one argument, while \textit{Group
  Components} are {\LaTeX} environments that hold the commands for its
consitutent Components:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=tex]
\begin{<Container>}[<options>]
  \<Component1>{<Content1>}
  \<Component2>{<Content2>}
  \begin{<GroupComponent>}
    \<Component3>{<Content3>}
    \<Component4>{<Content4>}
  \end{<GroupComponent>}
\end{<Container>}
\end{lstlisting}

The basic idea is that the content in the argument of the
\textit{Component} commands within a \textit{Container} are collected,
processed and the output is printed at the \lstinline{\end} of the
corresponding Container environment.  \textit{Components} are only
allowed within their corresponding \textit{Container}
environments. Outside of those environments,
\textit{Container}-sensitive \textit{Components} may have a different
meaning or even throw an \texttt{Undefined control sequence} error.

\textit{Components} provided by the modules of the {\CoCoTeX}
framework usually start with the \lstinline{tp}\footnote{That the
  prefix is „tp“ has historic reasons: The earliest version of
  {\CoCoTeX} was called „transpect-tex“ after the XML conversion tool
  \textit{transpect}, which constitutes the first major component of
  \textit{xerif} (with {\CoCoTeX} being the second).} prefix and the
component's names begin with a capital letter. For instance,
\begin{lstlisting}[style=tex]
\begin{tpFigure}
  \tpCaption{A~nice image.}
\end{tpFigure}
\end{lstlisting}
is a \textit{Component} named \texttt{Caption} with the
\textit{Content} \texttt{A~nice image.} within the \textit{Container}
\texttt{tpFigure}. Note that the \textit{macro} used to fill the
\textit{Component} is named slightly different from the
\textit{Component's} actual \textit{name}: the \lstinline{tp} prefix
doesn't count as part of the \textit{Component} name. This distinction
is important when the \textit{Components} are processed via the
\textit{Property} instructions.

\textit{Properties} consist of two parts: the property's \textit{name}
and its \textit{value}. Some Properties provided by the {\CoCoTeX}
modules may have a~fixed set of string values, while others are
completely free to be set and used.

In this manual, the properties provided by the various modules are
documented in the following way:

{\let\noindex\relax\describeProp{<name>}{\texttt{<allowed values>}}{\texttt{<default value>}}}

A property with the name \lstinline{<name>} is set by default to
\lstinline{<default value>}. The user may chose to set it to any of
the \lstinline{<allowed values>}.
\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{<any>}]  the user is completely free to set this
  property to any value she wants.
\item[\texttt{<dimen>}] It is expected the property to be a
  dimension. This may be a length or dimension register, a fix
  value-unit pair that is understood by \TeX, or a macro that expands
  to a dimension/length.
\item[\texttt{<num>}] It is expected the property to be a numeric
  value. This may be a counter register, a fix value, or a macro that
  expands to a number.
\end{description}
\lstinline{<allowed values>} without angles mean that those are fixes
strings that have a special meaning. Those are explained in the
descriptions below the Property header.

The “data type” \texttt{<empty>} is used to indicate that the property
is un-set or empty by default. While some of the properties provided
by the {\CoCoTeX} modules are indeed empty by default, basicly all
Properties can be set to \texttt{<empty>}.


\begin{heading}[label=sec:modules]{section}
  \tpTitle{Overview: Modules}
\end{heading}

The following modules are included in {\CoCoTeX}:

\begin{heading}{subsection}
  \tpTitle{User-Level Modules}
\end{heading}

\begin{description}
\item[\ttfamily coco-headings.sty] The \lstinline{headings}
  module\index{coco-headings.sty} provides a new way to declare and
  use chapter, section and paragraph titles. It is described in
  greater detail in \fullref{chap:headings}.
\item[\ttfamily coco-floats.sty] The \lstinline{floats}
  module\index{coco-floats.sty} provides some extended handling for
  floating objects like tables or figures. It is described in greater
  detail in \fullref{chap:floats}.
\item[\ttfamily coco-title.sty] The
  \lstinline{title}\index{coco-title.sty} module provides meta data
  handlers for title pages. It is described in greater detail in
  \fullref{chap:title}.
\item[\ttfamily coco-frame.sty] \index{coco-frame.sty}
\item[\ttfamily coco-notes.sty] The \lstinline{notes}
  module\index{coco-notes.sty} handles the easy switching between
  footnotes and endnotes, as well as the position where and in what
  way endnotes are printed. It is described in greater detail in
  \fullref{chap:endnotes}.
\end{description}

\begin{heading}{subsection}
  \tpTitle{Backend Modules}
\end{heading}

\begin{description}
\item[\ttfamily coco-kernel.sty] The \lstinline{kernel}
  module\index{coco-kernel.sty} is the heart of the {\CoCoTeX}
  framwork. As such, it is a hard dependency for all other modules and
  loaded automatically.
\item[\ttfamily coco-common.sty] The \lstinline{common}
  module\index{coco-common.sty} is a collection helper macros and
  functions, that are not per-se part of the {\CoCoTeX} Framework, but
  utilised by multiple other modules. The common module is loaded
  automatically by some of the other modules, but not by all.
\item[\ttfamily coco-meta.sty] The \lstinline{meta}
  module\index{coco-common.sty} collects methods and concepts that are
  used by both the \lstinline{title} and \lstinline{headings}
  modules. It is therefore auto-loaded by both modules.
\end{description}


\begin{heading}[sec:intro:experimental]{subsection}
  \tpTitle{Experimental Modules}
\end{heading}

\textbf{WARNING!\\
  The modules in this section are to be considered highly experimental!\\
  Use with caution!}

\begin{description}
\item[\ttfamily coco-script.sty] provides support for non-latin scripts by utilizing Google's Noto fonts. This module requires the \lstinline{xerif-fonts} installed\footnote{see \url{https://subversion.le-tex.de/common/xerif-fonts/}} and lua\LaTeX\footnote{Xe\LaTeX might work, but is unsupported and untested}.
\item[\ttfamily coco-accessibility.sty] provides support for various accessibility features. Requires {lua\LaTeX}\footnote{dito.}!
\item[\ttfamily coco-lists.sty] provides support for lists of various types.
\end{description}

The \lstinline{script} and \lstinline{lists} modules are not
automatically included with the \lstinline{cocotex.cls} document class
file. You need to include them manually in your main tex file. The
\lstinline{accessibility} module can be accessed via the value-less
\lstinline{ally} class option.
